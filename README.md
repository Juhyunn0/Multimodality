# Scene Classification: Images and Audio

This project aims to develop a scene classification model that utilizes both image and audio data, leveraging a dataset from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/scene-classification-images-and-audio).

## Project Overview

In this project, we performed the following key tasks:

1. **Concatenate Model**: Built a model that processes combined image and audio data as a single input.
2. **Model Comparison**: 
   - Visual Model: Compared with a model using only image data.
   - Audio Model: Compared with a model using only audio data.
3. **Visualization**: Employed Grad-CAM and Confusion Matrix to visualize model performance.
4. **Cross-Attention Model**: Implemented a Cross-Attention model to learn interactions between image and audio data.
